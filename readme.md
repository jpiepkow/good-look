good-look
======

Description: this module wraps prettier formatter to glob an entire directory for .js files and call 'prettier --write FILENAME' It is just here so you don't have to go through each file or write as much. I must state that it writes a new file to disk so make sure you look at prettier module before you run this code the first time to know how it formats.


**ignores node_module folder**

Getting started:

	npm install good-look -g
	
Running:

	goodlook
	
	^ call from directory you want formatted and watch as your files
	are wrote in a new style.
